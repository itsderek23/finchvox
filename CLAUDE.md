- Use `uv` to manage the environment + dependencies and not `pip`.
- Minimize code in src/finchvox/ui_routes.py. Abstract functionality to Python classes like src/finchvox/session.py.
- When planning, ensure tests are written for each feature.
- Prior to commiting, run codescene - pre_commit_code_health_safeguard (MCP).
